Inputs : Name of card or cards (can take a list)
         # of copies of the desired card or cards ( have a option for total copies or any amount of different cards.)
         # of chances to draw the desired cards ( this number needs to be bigger then the previous numbers)
         Version one Focus on a single card
         Version two Focus on cards based on effect (ie drawing cards/ removing cards from the deck changes the numbers).
         
         Version One:
         Given K = number of sucesses possilbe in the pool
         L = Number of sucesses wanted from the pool
         N = size of the pool
         X = number of chances to draw
         (K Choose L)*(N-K Choose L-K)/ (N choose X)
          Example (I have 4 copies of dark confidant in my 60 card deck, what is the likelyhood of drawing one in my opening hand of 7 card?
          K = 4
          L = 1
          N = 60
          X = 7
          (4 choose 1)*(60-4 Choose 1-4)/(60 Choose 7) = The chance to have a single copy of a card in your opening hand.
          
          Let K be the total number of cards found within the deck 
              If there is only one card
                Seach the deck and return how many copies of that specific card maximum 4.
              If there is more then one card
                Search the deck and return how many copies of the specified cards maxmimum (# of unique cards * 4).
          Let L be the number of copies they want to draw

          Let N be the size of the deck
            Ask for the deck size Minumum 60 cards
          Let X be the Chances to draw the cards
